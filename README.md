# dax-opsdashboard
Operations Dashboard for DAX

The dashboard can be run locally by cloning this repo and then running "python index.py". Authentication is done using dash_auth package after loading from a file. Since the slurm job statuses are updated via squeue, the dashboard does not run in a docker.
